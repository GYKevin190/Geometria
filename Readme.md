# Fractal Curve Generator Repository

This repository contains Python scripts for generating and visualizing various fractal curves in both 2D and 3D.

## Contents

### 2D Fractal Generator (`2d_fractals.py`)
- Generates classic Koch snowflake and its variations  
  - Koch curve  
  - Square Koch curve  
  - Lévy C curve  
  - Zigzag pattern  
  - Wave pattern  
- Calculates:  
  - Curve length  
  - Fractal dimension estimation  
- Matplotlib visualization  

### 3D Fractal Generator (`3d_fractal.py`)  
- Creates 3D Koch-like curves with:  
  - 3D vector rotations  
  - Customizable axes of rotation  
- Features:  
  - Length calculation  
  - Fractal dimension estimation  
  - Interactive 3D visualization  

## Key Features  
✔ Custom iteration levels for detail control  
✔ Support for arbitrary segment ratios and angles  
✔ Mathematical analysis of fractal properties  
✔ Clean visualizations with info overlays  

## Requirements
