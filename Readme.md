Fractal Curve Generator Repository
This repository contains Python scripts for generating and visualizing various fractal curves in both 2D and 3D.

Contents
2D Fractal Generator (2d_fractals.py):

Generates classic Koch snowflake and its variations

Includes square Koch curve, LÃ©vy C curve, zigzag, and wave patterns

Calculates curve length and estimates fractal dimension

Visualizes with Matplotlib

3D Fractal Generator (3d_fractal.py):

Creates 3D Koch-like curves with rotations in 3D space

Implements vector rotation in three dimensions

Provides length calculation and fractal dimension estimation

3D visualization using Matplotlib's 3D toolkit

Features
Customizable iterations for detail control

Support for arbitrary segment ratios and angles

Mathematical analysis of fractal properties

Clean visualization with informative overlays

Requirements
Python 3

NumPy

Matplotlib

The scripts demonstrate mathematical concepts of fractal geometry while providing visually appealing representations of these complex structures.
